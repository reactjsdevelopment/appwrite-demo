# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Vite is now the recommended method way of creating react projects
npm create vite@latest appwrite-demo -- --template react && cd appwrite-demo
npm run dev -- --open --port 300
npm install appwrite@14.0.1

You need projectID to work on this project. Create a organization and under that create a project.
