## üì¶ **What are the Official Plugins?**

To enhance your project, you have two official plugins available:

1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: 
   - Uses **Babel** to enable Fast Refresh, which means your changes will reflect in real time without losing your component state.
   
2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: 
   - Utilizes **SWC**, a super-fast compiler, to achieve even quicker refresh times.

```bash
# Create a new project with the React template
npm create vite@latest appwrite-demo -- --template react

# Navigate into your project directory
cd appwrite-demo

# Start the development server and open your project in a browser on port 300
npm run dev -- --open --port 300

# Install the Appwrite SDK
npm install appwrite@14.0.1
```

### **Step 2: Set Up Your Project ID**
